.. _sql:

Running SQL queries
===================

Datasette treats SQLite database files as read-only and immutable. This means it
is not possible to execute INSERT or UPDATE statements using Datasette, which
allows us to expose SELECT statements to the outside world without needing to
worry about SQL injection attacks.

The easiest way to execute custom SQL against Datasette is through the web UI.
The database index page includes a SQL editor that lets you run any SELECT query
you like. You can also construct queries using the filter interface on the
tables page, then click "View and edit SQL" to open that query in the custom
SQL editor.

Note that this interface is only available if the :ref:`permissions_execute_sql`
permission is allowed.

Any Datasette SQL query is reflected in the URL of the page, allowing you to
bookmark them, share them with others and navigate through previous queries
using your browser back button.

You can also retrieve the results of any query as JSON by adding ``.json`` to
the base URL.

.. _sql_parameters:

Named parameters
----------------

Datasette has special support for SQLite named parameters. Consider a SQL query
like this:

.. code-block:: sql

    select * from Street_Tree_List
    where "PermitNotes" like :notes
    and "qSpecies" = :species

If you execute this query using the custom query editor, Datasette will extract
the two named parameters and use them to construct form fields for you to
provide values.

You can also provide values for these fields by constructing a URL::

    /mydatabase?sql=select...&species=44

SQLite string escaping rules will be applied to values passed using named
parameters - they will be wrapped in quotes and their content will be correctly
escaped.

Datasette disallows custom SQL queries containing the string PRAGMA (with a small number `of exceptions <https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/761>`__) as SQLite pragma statements can be used to change database settings at runtime. If you need to include the string "pragma" in a query you can do so safely using a named parameter.

.. _sql_views:

Views
-----

If you want to bundle some pre-written SQL queries with your Datasette-hosted
database you can do so in two ways. The first is to include SQL views in your
database - Datasette will then list those views on your database index page.

The quickest way to create views is with the SQLite command-line interface::

    $ sqlite3 sf-trees.db
    SQLite version 3.19.3 2017-06-27 16:48:08
    Enter ".help" for usage hints.
    sqlite> CREATE VIEW demo_view AS select qSpecies from Street_Tree_List;
    <CTRL+D>

.. _canned_queries:

Canned queries
--------------

As an alternative to adding views to your database, you can define canned
queries inside your ``metadata.json`` file. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "databases": {
           "sf-trees": {
               "queries": {
                   "just_species": {
                       "sql": "select qSpecies from Street_Tree_List"
                   }
               }
           }
        }
    }

Then run Datasette like this::

    datasette sf-trees.db -m metadata.json

Each canned query will be listed on the database index page, and will also get
its own URL at::

    /database-name/canned-query-name

For the above example, that URL would be::

    /sf-trees/just_species

You can optionally include ``"title"`` and ``"description"`` keys to show a
title and description on the canned query page. As with regular table metadata
you can alternatively specify ``"description_html"`` to have your description
rendered as HTML (rather than having HTML special characters escaped).

.. _canned_queries_named_parameters:

Canned query parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Canned queries support named parameters, so if you include those in the SQL you
will then be able to enter them using the form fields on the canned query page
or by adding them to the URL. This means canned queries can be used to create
custom JSON APIs based on a carefully designed SQL statement.

Here's an example of a canned query with a named parameter:

.. code-block:: sql

    select neighborhood, facet_cities.name, state
    from facetable
      join facet_cities on facetable.city_id = facet_cities.id
    where neighborhood like '%' || :text || '%'
    order by neighborhood;

In the canned query metadata (here :ref:`metadata_yaml` as ``metadata.yaml``) it looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    databases:
      fixtures:
        queries:
          neighborhood_search:
            sql: |-
              select neighborhood, facet_cities.name, state
              from facetable
                join facet_cities on facetable.city_id = facet_cities.id
              where neighborhood like '%' || :text || '%'
              order by neighborhood
            title: Search neighborhoods

Here's the equivalent using JSON (as ``metadata.json``):

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "databases": {
            "fixtures": {
                "queries": {
                    "neighborhood_search": {
                        "sql": "select neighborhood, facet_cities.name, state\nfrom facetable\n  join facet_cities on facetable.city_id = facet_cities.id\nwhere neighborhood like '%' || :text || '%'\norder by neighborhood",
                        "title": "Search neighborhoods"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Note that we are using SQLite string concatenation here - the ``||`` operator - to add wildcard ``%`` characters to the string provided by the user.

You can try this canned query out here:
https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/neighborhood_search?text=town

In this example the ``:text`` named parameter is automatically extracted from the query using a regular expression.

You can alternatively provide an explicit list of named parameters using the ``"params"`` key, like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    databases:
      fixtures:
        queries:
          neighborhood_search:
            params:
            - text
            sql: |-
              select neighborhood, facet_cities.name, state
              from facetable
                join facet_cities on facetable.city_id = facet_cities.id
              where neighborhood like '%' || :text || '%'
              order by neighborhood
            title: Search neighborhoods

.. _canned_queries_options:

Additional canned query options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional options can be specified for canned queries in the YAML or JSON configuration.

hide_sql
++++++++

Canned queries default to displaying their SQL query at the top of the page. If the query is extremely long you may want to hide it by default, with a "show" link that can be used to make it visible.

Add the ``"hide_sql": true`` option to hide the SQL query by default.

fragment
++++++++

Some plugins, such as `datasette-vega <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-vega>`__, can be configured by including additional data in the fragment hash of the URL - the bit that comes after a ``#`` symbol.

You can set a default fragment hash that will be included in the link to the canned query from the database index page using the ``"fragment"`` key.

This example demonstrates both ``fragment`` and ``hide_sql``:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "databases": {
            "fixtures": {
                "queries": {
                    "neighborhood_search": {
                        "sql": "select neighborhood, facet_cities.name, state\nfrom facetable join facet_cities on facetable.city_id = facet_cities.id\nwhere neighborhood like '%' || :text || '%' order by neighborhood;",
                        "fragment": "fragment-goes-here",
                        "hide_sql": true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

`See here <https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures#queries>`__ for a demo of this in action.

.. _canned_queries_writable:

Writable canned queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Canned queries by default are read-only. You can use the ``"write": true`` key to indicate that a canned query can write to the database.

See :ref:`authentication_permissions_query` for details on how to add permission checks to canned queries, using the ``"allow"`` key.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "databases": {
            "mydatabase": {
                "queries": {
                    "add_name": {
                        "sql": "INSERT INTO names (name) VALUES (:name)",
                        "write": true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

This configuration will create a page at ``/mydatabase/add_name`` displaying a form with a ``name`` field. Submitting that form will execute the configured ``INSERT`` query.

You can customize how Datasette represents success and errors using the following optional properties:

- ``on_success_message`` - the message shown when a query is successful
- ``on_success_redirect`` - the path or URL the user is redirected to on success
- ``on_error_message`` - the message shown when a query throws an error
- ``on_error_redirect`` - the path or URL the user is redirected to on error

For example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "databases": {
            "mydatabase": {
                "queries": {
                    "add_name": {
                        "sql": "INSERT INTO names (name) VALUES (:name)",
                        "write": true,
                        "on_success_message": "Name inserted",
                        "on_success_redirect": "/mydatabase/names",
                        "on_error_message": "Name insert failed",
                        "on_error_redirect": "/mydatabase"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

You can use ``"params"`` to explicitly list the named parameters that should be displayed as form fields - otherwise they will be automatically detected.

You can pre-populate form fields when the page first loads using a query string, e.g. ``/mydatabase/add_name?name=Prepopulated``. The user will have to submit the form to execute the query.

.. _canned_queries_magic_parameters:

Magic parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Named parameters that start with an underscore are special: they can be used to automatically add values created by Datasette that are not contained in the incoming form fields or query string.

Available magic parameters are:

``_actor_*`` - e.g. ``_actor_id``, ``_actor_name``
    Fields from the currently authenticated :ref:`authentication_actor`.

``_header_*`` - e.g. ``_header_user_agent``
    Header from the incoming HTTP request. The key should be in lower case and with hyphens converted to underscores e.g. ``_header_user_agent`` or ``_header_accept_language``.

``_cookie_*`` - e.g. ``_cookie_lang``
    The value of the incoming cookie of that name.

``_now_epoch``
    The number of seconds since the Unix epoch.

``_now_date_utc``
    The date in UTC, e.g. ``2020-06-01``

``_now_datetime_utc``
    The ISO 8601 datetime in UTC, e.g. ``2020-06-24T18:01:07Z``

``_random_chars_*`` - e.g. ``_random_chars_128``
    A random string of characters of the specified length.

Here's an example configuration (this time using ``metadata.yaml`` since that provides better support for multi-line SQL queries) that adds a message from the authenticated user, storing various pieces of additional metadata using magic parameters:

.. code-block:: yaml

    databases:
      mydatabase:
        queries:
          add_message:
            allow:
              id: "*"
            sql: |-
              INSERT INTO messages (
                user_id, message, datetime
              ) VALUES (
                :_actor_id, :message, :_now_datetime_utc
              )
            write: true

The form presented at ``/mydatabase/add_message`` will have just a field for ``message`` - the other parameters will be populated by the magic parameter mechanism.

Additional custom magic parameters can be added by plugins using the :ref:`plugin_hook_register_magic_parameters` hook.

.. _canned_queries_json_api:

JSON API for writable canned queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writable canned queries can also be accessed using a JSON API. You can POST data to them using JSON, and you can request that their response is returned to you as JSON.

To submit JSON to a writable canned query, encode key/value parameters as a JSON document::

    POST /mydatabase/add_message

    {"message": "Message goes here"}

You can also continue to submit data using regular form encoding, like so::

    POST /mydatabase/add_message

    message=Message+goes+here

There are three options for specifying that you would like the response to your request to return JSON data, as opposed to an HTTP redirect to another page.

- Set an ``Accept: application/json`` header on your request
- Include ``?_json=1`` in the URL that you POST to
- Include ``"_json": 1`` in your JSON body, or ``&_json=1`` in your form encoded body

The JSON response will look like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "ok": true,
        "message": "Query executed, 1 row affected",
        "redirect": "/data/add_name"
    }

The ``"message"`` and ``"redirect"`` values here will take into account ``on_success_message``, ``on_success_redirect``, ``on_error_message`` and ``on_error_redirect``, if they have been set.

.. _pagination:

Pagination
----------

Datasette's default table pagination is designed to be extremely efficient. SQL
OFFSET/LIMIT pagination can have a significant performance penalty once you get
into multiple thousands of rows, as each page still requires the database to
scan through every preceding row to find the correct offset.

When paginating through tables, Datasette instead orders the rows in the table
by their primary key and performs a WHERE clause against the last seen primary
key for the previous page. For example:

.. code-block:: sql

    select rowid, * from Tree_List where rowid > 200 order by rowid limit 101

This represents page three for this particular table, with a page size of 100.

Note that we request 101 items in the limit clause rather than 100. This allows
us to detect if we are on the last page of the results: if the query returns
less than 101 rows we know we have reached the end of the pagination set.
Datasette will only return the first 100 rows - the 101st is used purely to
detect if there should be another page.

Since the where clause acts against the index on the primary key, the query is
extremely fast even for records that are a long way into the overall pagination
set.

.. _cross_database_queries:

Cross-database queries
----------------------

SQLite has the ability to run queries that join across multiple databases. Up to ten databases can be attached to a single SQLite connection and queried together.

Datasette can execute joins across multiple databases if it is started with the ``--crossdb`` option::

    datasette fixtures.db extra_database.db --crossdb

If it is started in this way, the ``/_memory`` page can be used to execute queries that join across multiple databases.

References to tables in attached databases should be preceded by the database name and a period.

For example, this query will show a list of tables across both of the above databases:

.. code-block:: sql

    select
      'fixtures' as database, *
    from
      [fixtures].sqlite_master
    union
    select
      'extra_database' as database, *
    from
      [extra_database].sqlite_master

`Try that out here <https://latest.datasette.io/_memory?sql=select%0D%0A++%27fixtures%27+as+database%2C+*%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++%5Bfixtures%5D.sqlite_master%0D%0Aunion%0D%0Aselect%0D%0A++%27extra_database%27+as+database%2C+*%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++%5Bextra_database%5D.sqlite_master>`__.
